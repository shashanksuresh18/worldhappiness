World Happiness Report Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report data, focusing on various factors that contribute to the happiness scores of different countries. By exploring this dataset, we aim to uncover insights into how economic, social, and health factors affect a country's happiness score.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the World Happiness Report 2016 (2016.csv). It includes various indicators such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and more, all of which are believed to impact a nation’s happiness score.
